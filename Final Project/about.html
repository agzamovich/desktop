        	<h3>Hi my name is...</h3>
        	<p>Dilshod, I was born on April, 24 1988 in the heart of Tashkent city, capital of Uzbekistan. At the time it was called United Soviet Social Republic (USSR). Nevertheless, I lived almost my whole life in a modern society. During the period of 1989-1991 so called "USSR" collapsed and new era entered into peoples lives in Uzbekistan. Not only Uzbekistan's population but the whole eastern and european countries who were in the USSR. Why new era? Because a lot of peope I know of kept telling me that they lived in a disaster while the USSR was in tactical and strategical opponent of the almost the 3/4 (three quarter) of the world. But the reality is on the other hand. Because I also know many people who lived very happy and joyous life while the Soviet Union had the leadership. I am being confident in these factual secrets because of my parents. They or us all together lived happily ever. My Father was a agriculturist and my mother was and still is Doctor of babies (Pediatrics). <br><br>In our family I'm the youngest one. Yeah you read it right... I have eldest sister (Nigora) and elder brother (Davron). They were so kind to me whilst i was growing up as a young baby. However, after I reached the age of 12, I started to be selfish and started to fight with my brother when at the time he was 15. We fought over some pity stuff which I don't remember anymore. My sister on the other hand, she was so busy with her school. She was and still is so good at mathematics. I learned many stuff from her. She even helped me to prepare for my Institute entrance exams. Yeah, by the way I was a very famous student at the Tashkent Chemical-Technological Institute (TCTI). The only reason for my famousness was my personality. Then, I was very indecent disobedient and my behavior was deviant. I was in a Dean's office almost every week, talking about my indecency particularly my deviated behavior that departing markedly from the accepted norm. Though, my grades were all A's, B's and some C's. My childhood passed so fast. I blinked twice probably and I am already an adult. Maybe I am exaggerating but its true. After graduating the Institute in 2008, I flew straight to New York with my family. Total change in my life ever since. I shall be honest though, I never liked NY when I first landed. Maybe after couple of years I started to feel differently and started to adapt. Although, people were saying that in the USA money grows on trees, not true at all. If you move, you make decent money if not you will end up being in lower class. Pretty much everywhere is the same rule.</p>
