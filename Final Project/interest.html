                <h6>Soccer is my life...</h6><p>It is one of the best sports in the world. I can't imagine life without soccer. That said, I do play soccer in fact i play very well. Sometimes in a striker position sometimes in a defence position. When I was young back in Uzbekistan I played for national team for about 2 years.</p>

                <h6>Coding...</h6><p>Coding was my dream since I was a kid. My first ever computer was "IMB 386" back in 1995. I never had a time to study coding. When I found my time I found an amazing school called New York Code+Design Academy "NYCDA" in the heart of Manhattan. Thanks a lot for all school staff and especially Mr Scotty Eckenthal who is our class teacher at the moment. He taught us all we need for coding in Front End development, including HTML5, CSS3 and  JavaScript. He is the best teacher. Very clear explanation of all codes. I learned from scratch. Thanks Scotty.</p>
